                    If the 2nd term in an addition of three terms is <strong>decreased by 13</strong>, and the 3rd term
                    is <strong>increased by 45</strong>, while the 1st remains unchanged at <strong>23</strong>, what is
                    the new sum?
                </li>

                <li>
                    What happens to the sum of three terms if we <strong>increase the 1st by 32</strong>,
                    <strong>decrease the 2nd by 17</strong>, and <strong>increase the 3rd by 44</strong>?
                </li>

                <li>
                    What happens to the <strong>remainder</strong> of a subtraction in the following cases?
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>We increase the minuend by 8?</li>
                        <li>We decrease the minuend by 4?</li>
                        <li>We increase the subtrahend by 6?</li>
                        <li>We decrease the subtrahend by 5?</li>
                        <li>We increase the minuend by 3 and decrease the subtrahend by 5?</li>
                        <li>We decrease the minuend by 2 and increase the subtrahend by 1?</li>

                <li>
                    The sum of all three terms of a subtraction is 156. What is the minuend?
                </li>

                <li>
                    In a subtraction, the sum of all three terms is 360. Find the terms, knowing that the remainder is
                    <strong>three times the subtrahend</strong>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    In a subtraction, the <strong>sum</strong> of the subtrahend and remainder is 72, and the
                    <strong>difference</strong> between them is 10. Find the three terms.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The sum of two terms exceeds their difference by 50. Find the terms, knowing that one is
                    <strong>three times the other</strong>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The sum of the three terms in a subtraction is 548. Find the remainder, knowing that the subtrahend
                    is 32.
                </li>

                <li>
                    In a subtraction, the minuend exceeds the subtrahend by 62 units, and the subtrahend exceeds the
                    remainder by 21 units. Find the three terms, knowing that their total sum is 290.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The product of two numbers is 512. If one of the numbers is increased by 7, the product increases by
                    112. What are the two numbers?
                </li>
